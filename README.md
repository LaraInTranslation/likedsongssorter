# LikedSongsSorter

A tool (in development) that sorts your liked songs playlist in Spotify according to criteria that you can specify yourself.

For me the liked songs playlist is a dumping ground for everything that I've come across while listening to artist or song radios or even only my weekly recommended playlist. As someone that doesn't strictly adhere to one genre, listening to my liked songs feels like a riding a rollercoaster. It doesn't even matter if I shuffle it or not, it's already shuffled enough on its own.

Well, I'm a programmer and I'm too lazy to sort this chaos by hand so here comes my solution to this problem.

## Usage

Relax please, there's not a single line of code written yet.
